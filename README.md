# ConceptLoop-Multi-Agent-Micro-Tutor-for-Tough-Topics

### *Agents for Good — Education Track · Kaggle AI Agents Intensive Capstone · 2025*

## 📌 Overview

ConceptLoop is a **multi-agent AI tutoring system** designed to help students learn complex technical concepts through **step-by-step micro-teaching, adaptive explanations, quick quizzes, and progress-tracking memory**.

The system transforms any topic (e.g., *Binary Search*, *Recursion*, *Probability*, *Photosynthesis*) into a guided learning experience powered by sequential AI agents.
This solution targets **students with limited access to structured learning resources**, helping them learn faster and more effectively.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many students struggle to learn difficult subjects alone because:

* They don’t know **where to start** or **how to break topics into steps**
* Learning material is often too overwhelming or advanced
* Teachers cannot provide personalized explanations or continuous progress support
* Self-learning lacks feedback loops and real-time assessment

---

## 💡 Solution

ConceptLoop provides a **guided micro-learning system** using **multi-agent AI orchestration**, where:

1. A **Planner Agent** breaks a topic into small steps
2. A **Tutor Agent** explains each step clearly with examples
3. A **Quiz Agent** checks understanding and improves weak concepts
4. A **Coach Agent** coordinates agents, loops weak answers, and stores progress

This creates a **personalized, adaptive learning path** that feels like studying with a real human tutor.
